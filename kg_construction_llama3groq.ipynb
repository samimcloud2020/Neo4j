Outside of Apple, Cook engages in philanthropy; in March 2015 he said he planned to donate his fortune to charity. In 2014, Cook became the first chief executive of a Fortune 500 company to publicly come out as gay.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nTimothy Donald Cook was born on November 1, 1960, in Mobile, Alabama. He was baptized in a Baptist church and grew up in nearby Robertsdale. His father, Donald Cook, was a shipyard worker, and his mother, Geraldine Cook, worked at a pharmacy. Cook graduated salutatorian from Robertsdale High School in Alabama in 1978. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in industrial engineering from Auburn University in 1982 and a Master of Business Administration degree from Duke University in 1988.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Pre-Apple era ===\\nAfter graduating from Auburn University, Cook spent twelve years in IBM\\'s personal computer business, ultimately as director of North American fulfillment. During this time, Cook also earned his MBA from Duke University, becoming a Fuqua Scholar in 1988. Later, he was the chief operating officer of the computer reseller division of Intelligent Electronics. In 1997, he became the vice president for corporate materials at Compaq, but took up his position at Apple six months later.\\n\\n\\n=== Apple era ===\\n\\n\\n==== Early career ====\\nIn 1998, Steve Jobs asked Cook to join Apple. In a commencement speech at Auburn University, Cook said he decided to join Apple after meeting Jobs:\\n\\nAny purely rational consideration of cost and benefits lined up in Compaq\\'s favor, and the people who knew me best advised me to stay at Compaq... On that day in early 1998, I listened to my intuition, not the left side of my brain or for that matter even the people who knew me best... no more than five minutes into my initial interview with Steve, I wanted to throw caution and logic to the wind and join Apple. My intuition already knew that joining Apple was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work for the creative genius and to be on the executive team that could resurrect a great American company.\\nHis first position was senior vice president for worldwide operations. Cook closed factories and warehouses, and replaced them with contract manufacturers; this resulted in a reduction of the company\\'s inventory from months to days. Predicting its importance, his group had invested in long-term deals such as advance investment in flash memory since 2005. This guaranteed a stable supply of what became the iPod Nano, then iPhone and iPad. Competitors at Hewlett-Packard described their cancelled HP TouchPad tablet computer and later said that it was made from \"cast-off, reject iPad parts\". Cook\\'s actions were recognized for keeping costs under control, and combined with the rest of the company, generated huge profits.\\n\\nIn January 2007, Cook was promoted to lead operations and was chief executive in 2009, while Jobs, in failing health, was away on a leave of absence.

After IBM introduced the IBM PC in 1981, its sales quickly surpassed the Apple II. In response, Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983. The Lisa\\'s graphical user interface was partially inspired by strategically licensed demonstrations of the Xerox Star. Lisa far surpassed the Star with intuitive direct manipulation, like the ability to drag and drop files, double-click to launch applications, and move or resize windows by clicking and dragging instead of going through a menu. However, hampered by its high price of $9,995 (equivalent to $33,000 in 2023) and lack of available software, the Lisa was commercially unsuccessful.\\nParallel to the Lisa\\'s development, a skunkworks team at Apple was working on the Macintosh project. Conceived in 1979 by Jef Raskin, Macintosh was envisioned as an affordable, easy-to-use computer for the masses. Raskin named the computer after his favorite type of apple, the McIntosh. The initial team consisted of Raskin, hardware engineer Burrell Smith, and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. In 1981, Steve Jobs was removed from the Lisa team and joined Macintosh, and was able to gradually take control of the project due to Wozniak\\'s temporary absence after an airplane crash. Under Jobs, the Mac grew to resemble the Lisa, with a mouse and a more intuitive graphical interface, at a quarter of the Lisa\\'s price.\\nUpon its January 1984 launch, the first Macintosh was described as revolutionary by The New York Times. Sales initially met projections, but dropped due to the machine\\'s low performance, single floppy disk drive requiring frequent disk swapping, and initial lack of applications. Author Douglas Adams said: \"But what I (and I think everybody else who bought the machine in the early days) fell in love with was not the machine itself, which was ridiculously slow and underpowered, but a romantic idea of the machine. And that romantic idea had to sustain me through the realities of actually working on the 128K Mac.\" Most of the original Macintosh team left Apple, and some followed Jobs to found NeXT after he was forced out by CEO John Sculley. The first Macintosh nevertheless generated cult enthusiasm among buyers and some developers, who rushed to develop entirely new programs for the platform, including PageMaker, MORE, and Excel.

He was born and raised in the South Bronx, New York, where he worked in his younger years as a taxi driver.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nMcGuirk was an alum of Cardinal Hayes High School. He worked in radio and television since 1986 after he graduated from College of Mount Saint Vincent in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, New York. He was best known for his long run as the executive producer of Imus in the Morning, a show that was nationally syndicated from 1993 until its end in 2018.\\n\\n\\n== Controversies ==\\n\\n\\n=== Tim Cook \"religious bigot\" controversy ===\\nOn April 1, 2015, during the Imus in the Morning show on Fox Business, McGuirk called Apple CEO Tim Cook a \"bigot hypocrite\" for \"running his mouth\" about the subject of the religious freedom Indiana law passed the month prior.\\n\\nMcGuirk: There is a lot of hypocrisy. First of all, Governor Cuomo tells all his state employees don\\'t go to Indiana but he\\'s going to Cuba where gay marriage is illegal and they maybe throw you in jail. You have this hypocrite, this bigot hypocrite, Tim Cook, who is running his mouth about the whole thing.McShane: The Apple CEO?McGuirk: Yeah. He sells products to Iran. He sells products to Saudi Arabia where they execute people if they\\'re gay.McDowell: A hypocrite maybe, but a bigot?McGuirk: A religious bigot, yeah. He won\\'t allow these religious people to exercise their freedom.McShane: That seems too strong to me.McGuirk: It does seem strong but in my opinion it happens to be accurate. If he doesn\\'t allow this Orthodox Jewish guy to refuse service...the point of the law is to allow him to exempt himself from a certain situation.McShane: This will end up back in the Supreme Court somewhere.McGuirk: And the governor of Connecticut. Meanwhile the state has the same law.McShane: But I think there is a difference in the law in terms...there are small differences in these laws. Some of these state laws are just to protect you against the government not against another person. So there are differences in those state laws.McGuirk: Gay rights and religious freedom are not mutually exclusive. They both can exist in the same universe and compromises have to be made. That\\'s just the way we work things out in this country. Tim Cook has to put his money where his mouth is. If he really feels that way, stop marketing Apple products in Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Nigeria where they not only dump on women and treat them as second class citizens but as I said they would execute gay people.\\n\\n\\n=== Jill Carroll ===\\nOn the Imus in the Morning show, McGuirk was not known to shy away from saying whatever was on his mind, and always in a heavily accented \"Brooklyn cabdriver\" deadpan that seemed both to amuse and horrify Imus in equal measure. Imus\\' sidekick, Charles McCord, often played the role of the instigator, doing his best to egg on McGuirk.\\nFor example, after the release of The Christian Science Monitor reporter Jill Carroll, who was kidnapped in Iraq, McGuirk stated: \"She strikes me as the kind of woman who would wear one of those suicide vests. You know, walk into the tent or try and sneak into the Green Zone.\\n\\n\\n=== Cardinals O\\'Connor and Egan ===\\nThe son of Irish immigrants and an altar boy in his youth, McGuirk did impersonations of John Cardinal O\\'Connor and Edward Cardinal Egan (both Archbishops of New York) in which he \"fashions an oversize FedEx envelope into a cone on his head ... Using a high-pitched Irish brogue ... the producer-as-cardinal said on the March 16 installment of the show that \\'the only thing Hillary Clinton has in common with the late great President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, God rest his soul, is that they both enjoyed extramarital affairs with women.\\'\"\\n\\n\\n=== U.S. President Barack Obama ===\\nRegarding Presidential aspirant Barack Obama, McGuirk stated: \"He\\'s a neophyte, no experience.

The device had a 14-inch CRT screen and a TV tuner card. It was not a commercial success, with only 10,000 sold before its discontinuation in 1994. That year, the company developed the Apple Interactive Television Box, a collaboration with BT Group and Proximus Group that was never released to the public. Apple\\'s final major attempt before the Apple TV was the Apple Pippin in 1990s, a combination home game console and networked computer.\\n\\n\\n== Models ==\\n\\n\\n=== First generation ===\\n\\nAt a September 2006 Apple special event, Apple announced the first-generation Apple TV. It was originally announced as \"iTV\" to fit into their \"i\"-based product naming convention, but was renamed \"Apple TV\" before launch due to a trademark dispute with British broadcasting network ITV, which threatened legal action against Apple. Pre-orders began in January 2007 and it was released in March 2007. It is based on a Pentium M processor and ran a variant of Mac OS X Tiger, and included a 40 GB hard disk for storing content. It supported output up to 720p on HDTVs via HDMI, and supported some standard definition televisions via component video. At launch, Apple TV required a Mac or Windows-based PC running iTunes on the same network to sync or stream content to it.\\nA model with a 160 GB hard drive was released in May 2007. The 40 GB version was discontinued in September 2009. In January 2008, it became a stand-alone device through a software update, which removed the requirement of iTunes syncing from separate computer, and allowed for media from services such as iTunes Store, MobileMe, and Flickr to be rented or purchased directly on the Apple TV.\\nIn July 2008, Apple released the software 2.1 update which added external recognition of iPhones and iPod Touches as alternative remote control devices to the Apple Remote. In September 2015, Apple discontinued iTunes support for the first-generation Apple TV, with accessibility being obstructed from such devices due to obsolete security standards.\\nThe first generation Apple TV can be modified into a makeshift intel Mac Mini, with a USB boot disk image being available online, and an install to the inbuilt hard drive possible by flashing the image to the hard drive through the USB booted disk. The device is not easily used unless a USB hub is installed, due to it only having one USB port.\\nThe first generation Apple TV has a 1 GHz Intel Pentium M CPU, and 256 MB of RAM. Neither the CPU or RAM can be upgraded without soldering, as both are soldered onto the motherboard. The device has one HDMI interface, one USB port, one 10/100 base T Ethernet port, and a Component video interface. Due to its thermal management design utilizing the upper case as a passive heat sink, the device gets warm when in use. A fan is used to cool the case, but it does not reach the CPU and is instead installed to cool the hard drive and installed power supply.\\n\\n\\n=== Second gener', metadata={'title': 'Apple TV', 'summary': 'Apple TV is a digital media player and microconsole developed and marketed by Apple Inc.

The microkernel for the car was named \"safetyOS\".\\n\\n\\n== Proposed collaborations and acquisitions ==\\nDuring the 2008–2010 automotive industry crisis, with car companies nearing collapse, Apple SVP Tony Fadell floated to Jobs the idea of buying General Motors on the cheap. The idea was abandoned partly because the company felt that it would be a bad look, and partly because of its focus on the iPhone.\\nFollowing Apple\\'s returned interest in 2014, Apple\\'s head of corporate development Adrian Perica met with Elon Musk several times with an interest in acquiring Tesla, which kicked off the research project. Tim Cook, Apple\\'s CEO, shut down these early negotiations, partly due to Apple\\'s CFO (and former GM Europe CFO) Luca Maestri saying how difficult the car business was. Despite the failure, years later, then-hardware chief Dan Riccio and former Ford engineer and iPhone engineer Steve Zadesky returned to Musk to discuss ideas for a collaboration.

A \"Flyover\" mode shows certain urban centers and other places of interest in a 3D landscape composed of models of buildings and structures.\\nFirst released in 2012, Apple Maps replaced Google Maps as the default map system on Apple devices. At launch, it drew criticism from users and reviewers for incorrect directions, sparse data about public transportation, and various other bugs and errors. Apple has since further developed the software to address the issues raised by such criticism.\\nWhile formerly exclusive to Apple devices, Apple released a cross-platform MapKit JS API in 2018, allowing Apple Maps to be embedded on the web.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Initial release ===\\n\\nApple revealed that the application would replace Google Maps as the default web mapping service for iOS. Apple also announced that the application would include turn-by-turn navigation, 3D maps, and the virtual assistant Siri. The mapping service was released on September 19, 2012. Following the launch, Apple Maps was heavily criticized, which resulted in a public apology by Apple CEO Tim Cook in late September and the departure of two key employees of Apple (see also §Early inaccuracy).\\nGoogle Maps was the default mapping app in iOS from the first generation iPhone in 2007. In late 2009, tensions between Google and Apple started when the Android version of Google Maps featured turn-by-turn navigation, a feature which the iOS version lacked. At the time, Apple argued that Google collected too much user data. When Apple made iOS 6 available, Google Maps could only be accessed by iOS 6 users via the web. Although Google did not immediately launch an iOS version Maps, shortly after the announcement of Apple Maps, Google did add a Flyover feature to its virtual globe application Google Earth. Three months later, in December 2012, Google Maps was released in the App Store. This version of Google Maps, unlike the previous version, featured turn-by-turn navigation. Shortly after it was launched, it was the most popular free application in the App Store.\\nSpeculation around Apple creating a mapping service of its own arose in 2009 after computer magazine Computerworld reported that Apple had acquired Jaron Waldman\\'s company Placebase, an online mapping service, in July of that year. The CEO of Placebase became a part of Apple\\'s \"Geo Team\". In the following two years, Apple acquired two more mapping related companies who specialized in 3D maps: Poly9 in 2010 and C3 Technologies in 2011. C3 Technologies\\' imagery was later used for the Flyovers feature in Apple Maps. Earlier in 2011, Apple indicated its plan for a mapping service when it stated on its website that it was collecting location data to create \"an improved traffic service in the next couple of years\" for iPhone users. In September 2012, when Apple Maps was released, a \"source\" connected to both Google and Apple Maps claimed to technology website TechCrunch that Apple was recruiting Google employees that worked on Google Maps.\\n\\n\\n=== 2012–2015 ===\\nIn the first year after its release, Apple Maps received a number of improvements which solved various errors in the application. Other changes included adding more satellite imagery and making the navigation available in more cities. In 2013, Apple also acquired a few companies to improve Apple Maps, namely HopStop, Embark, WifiSlam, and Locationary, as well as the team and the technology of the company BroadMap. HopStop and Embark both specialized in mapping public transportation, WifiSlam specialized in interior maps, Locationary provided accurate company data for mapping services, and BroadMap managed, sorted, and analyzed map data.\\nDuring WWDC in June 2013, Apple announced the new version of Apple Maps in iOS 7.

However, backlash from developers prompted the company to reconsider, with Jobs announcing in October 2007 that Apple would have a software development kit available for developers by February 2008. The SDK was released on March 6, 2008.\\nThe iPhone App Store opened on July 10, 2008. On July 11, the iPhone 3G was released and came pre-loaded with support for App Store. Initially apps could be free or paid, but then in 2009, Apple added the ability to add in-app purchases which quickly became the dominant way to monetize apps, especially games.\\nAfter the success of Apple\\'s App Store and the launch of similar services by its competitors, the term \"app store\" has been adopted to refer to any similar service for mobile devices. However, Apple applied for a U.S. trademark on the term \"App Store\" in 2008, which was tentatively approved in early 2011. In June 2011, U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton, who was presiding over Apple\\'s case against Amazon, said she would \"probably\" deny Apple\\'s motion to stop Amazon from using the \"App Store\" name. In July, Apple was denied preliminary injunction against Amazon\\'s Appstore by a federal judge.\\nThe term app has become a popular buzzword; in January 2011, app was awarded the honor of being 2010\\'s \"Word of the Year\" by the American Dialect Society. \"App\" has been used as shorthand for \"application\" since at least the late 1970s, and in product names since at least 2006, for example then-named Google Apps.\\nApple announced Mac App Store, a similar app distribution platform for its macOS personal computer operating system, in October 2010, with the official launch taking place in January 2011 with the release of its 10.6.6 \"Snow Leopard\" update.\\nIn February 2013, Apple informed developers that they could begin using appstore.com for links to their apps.

Their former bass player was Johnny Ray Allen, who had not been with the band since their 1996 farewell tour (documented the next year on the Live at Last CD) until a brief reunion in 2014. Willie Williams also contributed to three albums: Annunciation, Primitive Streak and Live at Last as a second guitarist. Annunciation (1994) was produced in part by Glyn Johns.\\nAfter regrouping in 2002 (first as The Dudes but then re-adopting the name \\'subdudes\\' in March 2003), Bob Dylan\\'s guitarist Freddy Koella helped produce Miracle Mule. The album Behind the Levee (2006) was produced by bluesman Keb\\' Mo\\' and yielded a minor hit, \"Papa Dukie and the Mud People\" (better known by its refrain, \"Love is a Beautiful Thing\"). Released in late 2007, the album Street Symphony was recorded in Nashville, Tennessee, at Blackbird Studios in March 2007 and was produced by George Massenburg, who has worked with Little Feat. Released in late 2008, Live at the Ram\\'s Head is available on CD or as a two DVD set, with one disc being the live show from \"The Ram\\'s Head\" in Annapolis, Maryland, and the second DVD being Unplugged at Pleasant Plains, with interviews and live studio footage from the recording of Street Symphony in Nashville.\\nMost recently (2009), the band\\'s self-produced Flower Petals was recorded in Magnie\\'s basement studio then mixed in Miami, Florida, by The Albert Brothers and Steve Alaimo. The album was a departure for the band, being much more country-oriented than previous releases. The cover art was by William Matthews, a Denver, Colorado, artist well known for his Old West-style paintings. Flower Petals was originally slated to be recorded as the follow-up to Miracle Mule in 2004 but was nixed by the band\\'s record company at the time, Back Porch Records.

The official event invite which was sent out to developers contained a graphic featuring an Apple logo made of layered colored glass, implied to be the new colors for the phone. A patent filed by Apple earlier in the year also hinted at a new camera design.\\n\\n\\n== Design ==\\n\\nThe iPhone 11 was available in six colors: Purple, Yellow, Green, Black, White and Product (Red). The top of the screen retains the 'notch' design, wherein the TrueDepth camera system and phone speaker are encapsulated in a black, rounded-out rectangle that dips into the screen, similar to its predecessor, the iPhone XR. An elevated area in the top corner on the back of the iPhone acts as a camera housing, containing the microphone, the flashlight, and both of the rear-facing digital cameras.

Apple created the device during a secretive collaboration with Cingular Wireless (later renamed AT&T Mobility) at an estimated development cost of US$150 million over thirty months. According to Jobs in 1998, the \"i\" word in \"iMac\" (and thereafter \"iPod\", \"iPhone\" and \"iPad\") stands for internet, individual, instruct, inform, and inspire.\\nApple rejected the \"design by committee\" approach that had yielded the Motorola ROKR E1, a largely unsuccessful \"iTunes phone\" made in collaboration with Motorola. Among other deficiencies, the ROKR E1\\'s firmware limited storage to only 100 iTunes songs to avoid competing with Apple\\'s iPod nano. Cingular gave Apple the liberty to develop the iPhone\\'s hardware and software in-house, a rare practice at the time, and paid Apple a fraction of its monthly service revenue (until the iPhone 3G), in exchange for four years of exclusive U.S. sales, until 2011.\\nJobs unveiled the first-generation iPhone to the public on January 9, 2007, at the Macworld 2007 convention at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. The iPhone incorporated a 3.5-inch multi-touch display with few hardware buttons, and ran the iPhone OS operating system with a touch-friendly interface, then marketed as a version of Mac OS X. It launched on June 29, 2007, at a starting price of US$499 in the United States, and required a two-year contract with AT&T. The price was reduced by a third after two months. The resulting complaints forced Jobs to issue an apology and offer a partial rebate to early purchasers of the phone.\\n\\nOn July 11, 2008, at Apple\\'s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2008, Apple announced the iPhone 3G, and expanded its launch-day availability to twenty-two countries, and it was eventually released in 70 countries and territories.

Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple would drop its proprietary Lightning connector by 2023. At the time of those claims, Apple was considering switching to USB-C due to the likelihood that the EU proposal would pass. The proposal was passed into law in October 2022, becoming the Radio Equipment Directive. Apple confirmed it would comply with the regulations later that month.\\nTwo weeks prior to the formal introduction of the iPhone 15, it was announced that some of the devices which were made in India would for the first time be sold around the world on the launch day.\\n\\n\\n== Design ==\\n\\nThe iPhone 15 is the first major redesign since the iPhone 12, featuring rounder edges and slightly curved display and back glass.

The leak was dubbed \"The Fappening\" or \"Celebgate\" by the public. The images were initially believed to have been obtained via a breach of Apple\\'s cloud services suite iCloud, or a security issue in the iCloud API which allowed them to make unlimited attempts at guessing victims\\' passwords. Apple claimed in a press release that access was gained via spear phishing attacks.\\nThe incident was met with varied reactions from the media and fellow celebrities.

Though the term is a vulgarism originating either with the imageboards where the pictures were initially posted or Reddit, mainstream media outlets soon adopted the term themselves, such as the BBC.  The term has received criticism from journalists like Radhika Sanghani of The Daily Telegraph and Toyin Owoseje of the International Business Times, who said that the term not only trivialized the leak, but also, according to Sanghani, \"[made] light of a very severe situation.\" Both articles used the term extensively to describe the event, including in their headlines.\\n\"Celebgate\" is a reference to the Watergate scandal.\\n\\n\\n== Procurement and distribution ==\\nThe images were obtained via the online storage offered by Apple\\'s iCloud platform for automatically backing up photos from iOS devices, such as iPhones. Apple later reported that the victims\\' iCloud account information was obtained using \"a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions\", such as phishing and brute-force attack guessing. It was believed that the images were obtained using an exploit in the Find My iPhone service. Court documents from 2014 indicated that one user created a fake email account called \"appleprivacysecurity\" to ask celebrities for security information.  The photos were being passed around privately for at least a couple of weeks before their public release on August 31. Some anonymous imageboard users at the time claimed that unreleased photos and videos exist.\\nThe hacker responsible for the leak, who described themselves as being a \"collector\", distributed the leaked images on the image boards 4chan and Anon-IB in exchange for Bitcoin.

Reddit administrators were criticized for allowing this to take place in an alleged violation of their anti-doxing rules. As McKayla Maroney claimed to be under 18 at the time the photos of her were taken, Reddit staff took photos of her down and warned that anyone re-posting them, or underage photos of Liz Lee which had been circulating prior to this incident, would be permanently banned from the site and could be prosecuted for distributing child pornography.

            "Timothy Donald Cook (born November 1, 1960) is an American business executive who is the current chief executive officer of Apple Inc. Cook had previously been the company's chief operating officer under its co-founder Steve Jobs. Cook joined Apple in March 1998 as a senior vice president for worldwide operations, and then as executive vice president for worldwide sales and operations. He was appointed chief executive on August 24, 2011 after Jobs, who was ill and died that October, resigned. During his tenure as the chief executive, he has advocated for the political reform of international and domestic surveillance, cybersecurity, American manufacturing, and environmental preservation. Since 2011 when he took over Apple, to 2020, Cook doubled the company's revenue and profit, and the company's market value increased from $348 billion to $1.9 trillion. Cook is also on the boards of directors of Nike, Inc. and the National Football Foundation; he is a trustee of Duke University, his alma mater. Outside of Apple, Cook engages in philanthropy; in March 2015 he said he planned to donate his fortune to charity. In 2014, Cook became the first chief executive of a Fortune 500 company to publicly come out as gay. Early life and education Timothy Donald Cook was born on November 1, 1960, in Mobile, Alabama. He was baptized in a Baptist church and grew up in nearby Robertsdale. His father, Donald Cook, was a shipyard worker, and his mother, Geraldine Cook, worked at a pharmacy. Cook graduated salutatorian from Robertsdale High School in Alabama in 1978. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in industrial engineering from Auburn University in 1982 and a Master of Business Administration degree from Duke University in 1988. Career = Pre-Apple era =After graduating from Auburn University, Cook spent twelve years in IBM's personal computer business, ultimately as director of North American fulfillment. During this time, Cook also earned his MBA from Duke University, becoming a Fuqua Scholar in 1988. Later, he was the chief operating officer of the computer reseller division of Intelligent Electronics. In 1997, he became the vice president for corporate materials at Compaq, but took up his position at Apple six months later.= Apple era = Early career In 1998, Steve Jobs asked Cook to join Apple. In a commencement speech at Auburn University, Cook said he decided to join Apple after meeting Jobs:Any purely rational consideration of cost and benefits lined up in Compaq's favor, and the people who knew me best advised me to stay at Compaq... On that day in early 1998, I listened to my intuition, not the left side of my brain or for that matter even the people who knew me best... no more than five minutes into my initial interview with Steve, I wanted to throw caution and logic to the wind and join Apple. My intuition already knew that joining Apple was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work for the creative genius and to be on the executive team that could resurrect a great American company.His first position was senior vice president for worldwide operations. Cook closed factories and warehouses, and replaced them with contract manufacturers; this resulted in a reduction of the company's inventory from months to days. Predicting its importance, his group had invested in long-term deals such as advance investment in flash memory since 2005. This guaranteed a stable supply of what became the iPod Nano, then iPhone and iPad. Competitors at Hewlett-Packard described their cancelled HP TouchPad tablet computer and later said that it was made from \"cast-off, reject iPad parts\". Cook's actions were recognized for keeping costs under control, and combined with the rest of the company, generated huge profits.In January 2007, Cook was promoted to lead operations and was chief executive in 2009, while Jobs, in failing health, was away on a leave of absence. In January 2011, Apple's board of Tim Cook  (born 1971) is a Canadian military historian and author. Cook is an historian at the Canadian War Museum and the author of thirteen books about the military history of Canada.  Having written extensively about World War I, Cook's focus shifted to Canada's involvement in World War II with the 2014 publication of the first volume in a two-volume series chronicling Canada's role in that war. He is a two-time recipient (2000 and 2015) of the C.P. Stacey Prize, a two-time recipient of the J.W. Dafoe Book Prize, and a three-time winner of the Ottawa Book Prize. He was elected to the Royal Society of Canada in 2019. He is a member of the Order of Canada. Background Cook was born in Kingston, Ontario, and raised in Ottawa.  He studied history at Trent University in Peterborough, and later obtained a master's degree at the Royal Military College of Canada and a doctorate at the University of New South Wales. Awards His 2000 book, No Place to Run, was awarded the C.P. Stacey Prize for best written work in Canadian military history. In 2006, he published Clio's Warriors, which explores the writing of the world wars in Canada. At the Sharp End: Canadians Fighting the Great War, 1914-1916, won the 2007 J.W. Dafoe award for literary non-fiction and the 2008 Ottawa Book award.  His 2008 book Shock Troops: Canadians Fighting the Great War 1917–1918 won the 2009 Charles Taylor Prize. The Madman and the Butcher: The Sensational Wars of Sam Hughes and General Arthur Currie was a finalist for the 2011 Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing, the 2011 J.W. Dafoe prize, and the 2011 Ottawa Book Award.  His 2012 book Warlords: Borden, Mackenzie King, and Canada's World Wars was a finalist for the 2013 Charles A. Taylor award for Literary Non-Fiction and the Canadian Authors Association Literary Award.The Necessary War received the 2015 C.P. Stacey Prize for best book in Canadian Military History and Fight to the Finish received the 2016 Ottawa Book Award.  In 2017, Cook published Vimy: Battle and Legend and in 2018 he published The Secret History of Soldiers: How Canadians Survived the Great War. Both were national best-sellers. Vimy received the 2017 J.W. Dafoe Book Prize and The Secret History received the Ottawa Book Prize. Almost all of these books have been national best sellers.In June 2020, Cook and J.L. Granatstein edited Canada 1919: A Nation Shaped by War Hardcover (UBC Press) and in September 2020, he published The Fight for History: 75 Years of Forgetting, Remembering, and Remaking Canada's Second World War Hardcover (Allen Lane). In 2022, he published Lifesavers and Body Snatchers: Medical Care and the Struggle for Survival in the Great War. It was long-listed for the Templer prize; his Vimy book was a finalist for the same prize.Cook was the recipient of the 2013 Pierre Berton Award (Governor General's History Award for Popular Media), which is awarded by Canada's National History Society.  The award was given to Cook for his work making military history \"more accessible, vivid and factual\", both in his role as an author and as the First World War Historian at the Canadian War Museum.Tim Cook is a member of the Royal Society of Canada and the Order of Canada.

McGuirk (October 26, 1957 – October 5, 2022) was an American radio personality. He was host at WABC in New York City alongside Sid Rosenberg. He was born and raised in the South Bronx, New York, where he worked in his younger years as a taxi driver. Background McGuirk was an alum of Cardinal Hayes High School. He worked in radio and television since 1986 after he graduated from College of Mount Saint Vincent in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, New York. He was best known for his long run as the executive producer of Imus in the Morning, a show that was nationally syndicated from 1993 until its end in 2018. Controversies = Tim Cook \"religious bigot\" controversy =On April 1, 2015, during the Imus in the Morning show on Fox Business, McGuirk called Apple CEO Tim Cook a \"bigot hypocrite\" for \"running his mouth\" about the subject of the religious freedom Indiana law passed the month prior.McGuirk: There is a lot of hypocrisy. First of all, Governor Cuomo tells all his state employees don't go to Indiana but he's going to Cuba where gay marriage is illegal and they maybe throw you in jail. You have this hypocrite, this bigot hypocrite, Tim Cook, who is running his mouth about the whole thing.McShane: The Apple CEO?McGuirk: Yeah. He sells products to Iran. He sells products to Saudi Arabia where they execute people if they're gay.McDowell: A hypocrite maybe, but a bigot?McGuirk: A religious bigot, yeah. He won't allow these religious people to exercise their freedom.McShane: That seems too strong to me.McGuirk: It does seem strong but in my opinion it happens to be accurate. If he doesn't allow this Orthodox Jewish guy to refuse service...the point of the law is to allow him to exempt himself from a certain situation.McShane: This will end up back in the Supreme Court somewhere.McGuirk: And the governor of Connecticut. Meanwhile the state has the same law.McShane: But I think there is a difference in the law in terms...there are small differences in these laws. Some of these state laws are just to protect you against the government not against another person. So there are differences in those state laws.McGuirk: Gay rights and religious freedom are not mutually exclusive. They both can exist in the same universe and compromises have to be made. That's just the way we work things out in this country. Tim Cook has to put his money where his mouth is. If he really feels that way, stop marketing Apple products in Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Nigeria where they not only dump on women and treat them as second class citizens but as I said they would execute gay people.= Jill Carroll =On the Imus in the Morning show, McGuirk was not known to shy away from saying whatever was on his mind, and always in a heavily accented \"Brooklyn cabdriver\" deadpan that seemed both to amuse and horrify Imus in equal measure. Imus' sidekick, Charles McCord, often played the role of the instigator, doing his best to egg on McGuirk.For example, after the release of The Christian Science Monitor reporter Jill Carroll, who was kidnapped in Iraq, McGuirk stated: \"She strikes me as the kind of woman who would wear one of those suicide vests. You know, walk into the tent or try and sneak into the Green Zone.= Cardinals O'Connor and Egan =The son of Irish immigrants and an altar boy in his youth, McGuirk did impersonations of John Cardinal O'Connor and Edward Cardinal Egan (both Archbishops of New York) in which he \"fashions an oversize FedEx envelope into a cone on his head ... Using a high-pitched Irish brogue ... the producer-as-cardinal said on the March 16 installment of the show that 'the only thing Hillary Clinton has in common with the late great President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, God rest his soul, is that they both enjoyed extramarital affairs with women.'\"= U.S. President Barack Obama =Regarding Presidential aspirant Barack Obama, McGuirk stated: \"He's a neophyte, no experience. It's all because he Apple TV is a digital media player and microconsole developed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is a small piece of networking hardware that sends received media data such as video and audio to a TV or external display. Its media services include streaming media, TV Everywhere-based services, local media sources, and sports journalism and broadcasts.Second-generation and later models function only when connected via HDMI to an enhanced-definition or high-definition widescreen television. Since the fourth-generation model, Apple TV runs tvOS with multiple pre-installed apps. In November 2019, Apple released Apple TV+ and Apple TV app a la carte.Apple TV lacks integrated controls and can only be controlled remotely, through a Siri Remote, iPhone or iPad, Apple Remote, or third-party infrared remotes complying with the fourth generation  Consumer Electronics Control standard. Background Before the Apple TV, Apple made a number of attempts to create TV-based devices: In 1993, Apple released the Macintosh TV in an attempt to enter the home-entertainment industry. The device had a 14-inch CRT screen and a TV tuner card. It was not a commercial success, with only 10,000 sold before its discontinuation in 1994. That year, the company developed the Apple Interactive Television Box, a collaboration with BT Group and Proximus Group that was never released to the public. Apple's final major attempt before the Apple TV was the Apple Pippin in 1990s, a combination home game console and networked computer. Models = First generation =At a September 2006 Apple special event, Apple announced the first-generation Apple TV. It was originally announced as \"iTV\" to fit into their \"i\"-based product naming convention, but was renamed \"Apple TV\" before launch due to a trademark dispute with British broadcasting network ITV, which threatened legal action against Apple. Pre-orders began in January 2007 and it was released in March 2007. It is based on a Pentium M processor and ran a variant of Mac OS X Tiger, and included a 40 GB hard disk for storing content. It supported output up to 720p on HDTVs via HDMI, and supported some standard definition televisions via component video. At launch, Apple TV required a Mac or Windows-based PC running iTunes on the same network to sync or stream content to it.A model with a 160 GB hard drive was released in May 2007. The 40 GB version was discontinued in September 2009. In January 2008, it became a stand-alone device through a software update, which removed the requirement of iTunes syncing from separate computer, and allowed for media from services such as iTunes Store, MobileMe, and Flickr to be rented or purchased directly on the Apple TV.In July 2008, Apple released the software 2.1 update which added external recognition of iPhones and iPod Touches as alternative remote control devices to the Apple Remote. In September 2015, Apple discontinued iTunes support for the first-generation Apple TV, with accessibility being obstructed from such devices due to obsolete security standards.The first generation Apple TV can be modified into a makeshift intel Mac Mini, with a USB boot disk image being available online, and an install to the inbuilt hard drive possible by flashing the image to the hard drive through the USB booted disk. The device is not easily used unless a USB hub is installed, due to it only having one USB port.The first generation Apple TV has a 1 GHz Intel Pentium M CPU, and 256 MB of RAM. Neither the CPU or RAM can be upgraded without soldering, as both are soldered onto the motherboard. The device has one HDMI interface, one USB port, one 10/100 base T Ethernet port, and a Component video interface. Due to its thermal management design utilizing the upper case as a passive heat sink, the device gets warm when in use. A fan is used to cool the case, but it does not reach the CPU and is instead installed to cool the hard drive and installed power supply.= Second gener Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American businessman, inventor, and investor best known for co-founding the technology giant Apple Inc. Jobs was also the founder of NeXT and chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar. He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.Jobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted shortly afterwards. He attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India, seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together, the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh launched the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics and PostScript.In 1985, Jobs departed Apple after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO, John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took some Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets, serving as its CEO. In 1986, he helped develop the visual effects industry by funding the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm that eventually spun off independently as Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer-animated feature film Toy Story (1995) and became a leading animation studio, producing over 27 films since.In 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company's acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible for reviving Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with British designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products and services that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the \"Think different\" advertising campaign, and leading to the iMac, iTunes, Mac OS X, Apple Store, iPod, iTunes Store, iPhone, App Store, and iPad. In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. He died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor in 2011, and in 2022, was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Early life = Family =Steven Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, on February 24, 1955, to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah \"John\" Jandali (Arabic: عبد الفتاح الجندلي). Abdulfattah Jandali was born in a Muslim household to wealthy Syrian parents, the youngest of nine siblings. After obtaining his undergraduate degree at the American University of Beirut, Jandali pursued a PhD in political science at the University of Wisconsin. There, he met Joanne Schieble, an American Catholic of Swiss-German descent whose parents owned a mink farm and real estate in Green Bay. The two fell in love but faced opposition from Schieble's father due to Jandali's Muslim faith. When Schieble became pregnant, she arranged for a closed adoption, and travelled to San Francisco to give birth.Schieble requested that her son be adopted by college graduates. A lawyer and his wife were selected, but they withdrew after discovering that the baby was a boy, so Jobs was instead adopted by Paul Reinhold and Clara (née Hagopian) Jobs. Paul Jobs, an American of German descent, was the son of a dairy farmer from Washington County, Wisconsin. After dropping out of high school, he worked as a mechanic, then joined the US Coast Guard. When his ship was decommissioned at San Francisco, he bet he could find a wife within 2 weeks. He th From 2014 until 2024, Apple Inc. undertook a research and development effort to develop an electric and self-driving car, codenamed \"Project Titan\". Apple never openly discussed any of its automotive research, but around 5,000 employees were reported to be working on the project as of 2018. In May 2018, Apple reportedly partnered with Volkswagen to produce an autonomous employee shuttle van based on the T6 Transporter commercial vehicle platform. In August 2018, the BBC reported that Apple had 66 road-registered driverless cars, with 111 drivers registered to operate those cars. In 2020, it was believed that Apple was still working on self-driving related hardware, software and service as a potential product, instead of actual Apple-branded cars. In December 2020, Reuters reported that Apple was planning on a possible launch date of 2024, but analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed it would not be launched before 2025 and might not be launched until 2028 or later. In February 2024, Apple executives canceled their plans to release the autonomous electric vehicle, instead shifting resources on the project to the company's generative artificial intelligence efforts. The project had reportedly cost the company over $1 billion per year, with other parts of Apple collaborating and costing hundreds of millions of dollars in additional spend. Additionally, over 600 employees were laid off due to the cancellation of the project. Car details The car project cycled through multiple designs over the years. Teams at Apple outside of the development project were involved in its development. People from the Apple silicon team were heavily involved in the car to design the processor used for its autonomy. At the time of cancelation, the chip was nearly finished, and had the equivalent processing power of four M2 Ultras combined. The microkernel for the car was named \"safetyOS\". Proposed collaborations and acquisitions During the 2008–2010 automotive industry crisis, with car companies nearing collapse, Apple SVP Tony Fadell floated to Jobs the idea of buying General Motors on the cheap. The idea was abandoned partly because the company felt that it would be a bad look, and partly because of its focus on the iPhone.Following Apple's returned interest in 2014, Apple's head of corporate development Adrian Perica met with Elon Musk several times with an interest in acquiring Tesla, which kicked off the research project. Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, shut down these early negotiations, partly due to Apple's CFO (and former GM Europe CFO) Luca Maestri saying how difficult the car business was. Despite the failure, years later, then-hardware chief Dan Riccio and former Ford engineer and iPhone engineer Steve Zadesky returned to Musk to discuss ideas for a collaboration. A few more years later, as Tesla struggled to make its Model 3 sedan, Musk attempted to restart talks with Apple, but said Cook wouldn't meet.A partnership with Mercedes-Benz was worked on, and was similar to talks with and progressed further than that with Tesla. The plan was for Mercedes-Benz to manufacture the car, and Apple to also provide Mercedes-Benz its self-driving platform and UI for other cars. Apple pulled out partly because it had confidence that it could successfully manufacture a car themselves and partly over disagreements over controlling the user's experience and data. The talks lasted for more than a year.The closest talks to acquire a car company were with McLaren. Some executives hoped that Jony Ive would be closer to Apple with that acquisition, following his reduced involvement in the company. BMW and Canoo, among others, were also in exploratory talks for an acquisition. Apple also met with Nissan and BYD Auto. Apple was concerned that integrating an automaker would be a disaster internally. Apple briefly partnered with Magna Steyr, a maker of low-volume vehicles for the project.In 2018, Apple signed a deal with Volkswagen to make an autonomous shuttle for  Scott James Forstall (born 28 August 1969) is an American software engineer, known for leading the original software development team for the iPhone and iPad. He is also a Broadway producer known for co-producing the Tony award-winning Fun Home and Eclipsed with Molly Forstall, his wife, among others. Having spent his career first at NeXT and then Apple, he was the senior vice president (SVP) of iOS Software at Apple Inc. from 2007 until October 2012. Early life and education Forstall grew up in a middle-class family in Kitsap County, Washington, the second-born of three boys to a registered-nurse mother Jeanne and an engineer father Tom Forstall. His older brother Bruce is also a senior software design engineer, at Microsoft.A gifted student for whom skills such as programming \"came easily where they were difficult for others\", Forstall qualified for advanced-placement science and math class in junior high school, and gained experience programming on Apple IIe computers.He was skipped forward a year, entering Olympic High School in Bremerton, Washington, early where classmates recall his immersion in competitive chess, history, and general knowledge, on occasion competing at the state level. He achieved a 4.0 GPA and earned the position of valedictorian, a position he shared with a classmate, Molly Brown, who would later become his wife. He had established the goal of being a \"designer of high-tech electronics equipment\", as he proclaimed in an interview with a local newspaper.Enrolling at Stanford University, he graduated in 1991 with a degree in symbolic systems. The next year he received his master's degree in computer science, also from Stanford. During his time at Stanford, Forstall was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. Career = NeXT / Apple =Forstall joined Steve Jobs's NeXT in 1992 and stayed when it was purchased by Apple in 1997. Forstall was then placed in charge of designing user interfaces for a reinvigorated Macintosh line. In 2000, Forstall became a leading designer of the Mac's new Aqua user interface, known for its water-themed visual cues such as translucent icons and reflections, making him a rising star in the company. He was promoted to SVP in January 2003. During this period, he supervised the creation of the Safari web browser. Lisa Melton, a senior developer on the Safari team, credited Forstall for being willing to trust the instincts of his team and respecting their ability to develop the browser in secret.In 2005, when Jobs began planning the iPhone, he had a choice to either \"shrink the Mac, which would be an epic feat of engineering, or enlarge the iPod\". Jobs favored the former approach but pitted the Macintosh and the iPod team, led by Forstall and Tony Fadell respectively, against each other in an internal competition. Forstall won that fierce competition to create iOS. The decision enabled the success of the iPhone as a platform for third-party developers: using a well-known desktop operating system as its basis allowed the many third-party Mac developers to write software for the iPhone with minimal retraining. Forstall was also responsible for creating a software developer's kit for programmers to build iPhone apps, as well as an App Store within iTunes.In 2006, Forstall became responsible for Mac OS X releases after Avie Tevanian stepped down as the company's Chief Software Technology Officer and before being named SVP of iPhone Software. Forstall received credit as he \"ran the iOS mobile software team like clockwork and was widely respected for his ability to perform under pressure\".He has spoken publicly at Apple Worldwide Developers Conferences, including talks about Mac OS X Leopard in 2006 and iPhone software development in 2008, later after the release of iPhone OS 2.0 and iPhone 3G, and on January 27, 2010, at Apple's 2010 iPad keynote. At WWDC 2011, Forstall introduced iOS 5. Forstall also appears in the iOS 5 video, narrating about three-quarters The App Store is an app marketplace developed and maintained by Apple Inc., for mobile apps on its iOS and iPadOS operating systems. The store allows users to browse and download approved apps developed within Apple's iOS SDK. Apps can be downloaded on the iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad, and some can be transferred to the Apple Watch smartwatch or 4th-generation or newer Apple TVs as extensions of iPhone apps.The App Store opened on July 10, 2008, with an initial 500 applications available. The number of apps peaked at around 2.2 million in 2017, but declined slightly over the next few years as Apple began a process to remove old or 32-bit apps. As of 2021, the store features more than 1.8 million apps.While Apple touts the role of the App Store in creating new jobs in the \"app economy\" and claims to have paid over $155 billion to developers, the App Store has also attracted criticism from developers and government regulators that it operates a monopoly and that Apple's 30% cut of revenues from the store is excessive. In October 2021, the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) concluded that in-app commissions from Apple's App Store are anti-competitive and would demand that Apple change its in-app payment system policies. History While originally developing iPhone prior to its unveiling in 2007, Apple's then-CEO Steve Jobs did not intend to let third-party developers build native apps for iOS, instead directing them to make web applications for the Safari web browser. However, backlash from developers prompted the company to reconsider, with Jobs announcing in October 2007 that Apple would have a software development kit available for developers by February 2008. The SDK was released on March 6, 2008.The iPhone App Store opened on July 10, 2008. On July 11, the iPhone 3G was released and came pre-loaded with support for App Store. Initially apps could be free or paid, but then in 2009, Apple added the ability to add in-app purchases which quickly became the dominant way to monetize apps, especially games.After the success of Apple's App Store and the launch of similar services by its competitors, the term \"app store\" has been adopted to refer to any similar service for mobile devices. However, Apple applied for a U.S. trademark on the term \"App Store\" in 2008, which was tentatively approved in early 2011. In June 2011, U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton, who was presiding over Apple's case against Amazon, said she would \"probably\" deny Apple's motion to stop Amazon from using the \"App Store\" name. In July, Apple was denied preliminary injunction against Amazon's Appstore by a federal judge.The term app has become a popular buzzword; in January 2011, app was awarded the honor of being 2010's \"Word of the Year\" by the American Dialect Society. \"App\" has been used as shorthand for \"application\" since at least the late 1970s, and in product names since at least 2006, for example then-named Google Apps.Apple announced Mac App Store, a similar app distribution platform for its macOS personal computer operating system, in October 2010, with the official launch taking place in January 2011 with the release of its 10.6.6 \"Snow Leopard\" update.In February 2013, Apple informed developers that they could begin using appstore.com for links to their apps. In June at its developer conference, Apple announced an upcoming \"Kids\" section in App Store, a new section featuring apps categorized by age range, and the section was launched alongside the release of iOS 7 in September 2013.In 2016, multiple media outlets reported that apps had decreased significantly in popularity. Recode wrote that \"The app boom is over\", an editorial in TechCrunch stated that \"The air of hopelessness that surrounds the mobile app ecosystem is obvious and demoralizing\", and The Verge wrote that \"the original App Store model of selling apps for a buck or two looks antiquated\". Issues included consumer \"boredom\", a lack of app discoverabi The Subdudes (styled lowercase as The subdudes) are an American roots rock group from New Orleans. Their music blends folk, swamp pop, New Orleans rhythm and blues, Louisiana blues, country, cajun/zydeco, funk, soul and gospel with harmonic vocals. Their sound is notable for the band's substitution of a tambourine player for a drummer. The subdudes formed in 1987 through a music venue in New Orleans called Tipitina's. History The Subdudes often credit their songwriting to the group as a whole, although the primary songwriters are Tommy Malone (brother of The Radiators guitarist Dave Malone) and John Magnie, both former members of Little Queenie and the Percolators.  Current members of the band are:Tommy Malone: vocals, acoustic, electric and slide guitarsJohn Magnie: vocals, accordion, keyboardsSteve Amedée: tambourine, drums, other percussion, and vocalsTim Cook: percussion, bass and vocalsJimmy Messa: bass and guitarThey are an Americana band with a rock-based sound that also shows soul,  gospel, blues, cajun/zydeco, country, and other American roots music influences. Their former bass player was Johnny Ray Allen, who had not been with the band since their 1996 farewell tour (documented the next year on the Live at Last CD) until a brief reunion in 2014. Willie Williams also contributed to three albums: Annunciation, Primitive Streak and Live at Last as a second guitarist. Annunciation (1994) was produced in part by Glyn Johns.After regrouping in 2002 (first as The Dudes but then re-adopting the name 'subdudes' in March 2003), Bob Dylan's guitarist Freddy Koella helped produce Miracle Mule. The album Behind the Levee (2006) was produced by bluesman Keb' Mo' and yielded a minor hit, \"Papa Dukie and the Mud People\" (better known by its refrain, \"Love is a Beautiful Thing\"). Released in late 2007, the album Street Symphony was recorded in Nashville, Tennessee, at Blackbird Studios in March 2007 and was produced by George Massenburg, who has worked with Little Feat. Released in late 2008, Live at the Ram's Head is available on CD or as a two DVD set, with one disc being the live show from \"The Ram's Head\" in Annapolis, Maryland, and the second DVD being Unplugged at Pleasant Plains, with interviews and live studio footage from the recording of Street Symphony in Nashville.Most recently (2009), the band's self-produced Flower Petals was recorded in Magnie's basement studio then mixed in Miami, Florida, by The Albert Brothers and Steve Alaimo. The album was a departure for the band, being much more country-oriented than previous releases. The cover art was by William Matthews, a Denver, Colorado, artist well known for his Old West-style paintings. Flower Petals was originally slated to be recorded as the follow-up to Miracle Mule in 2004 but was nixed by the band's record company at the time, Back Porch Records. Five years later, the band members financed the recording themselves then shopped around the completed tapes.The Subdudes' stature as New Orleans musicians was reflected by their inclusion individually and as a group in the HBO series Treme.After a hiatus starting in 2011, the original line-up reunited in March 2014, with Johnny Ray Allen on bass. Allen died on August 8, 2014, at age 56. The band continued to tour with Tim Cook on bass.  However, during the COVID pandemic, the band basically disbanded, posting a notice on bandsintown.com:  \"The Subdudes retired during the Covid-19 epidemic, but the members are active as solo artists and perform together on occasion.\" Discography 1989: The Subdudes (East West)1991: Lucky (East West)1994: Annunciation (High Street)1996: Primitive Streak (High Street)1997: Live at Last (High Street)2004: Miracle Mule (EMI/Back Porch)2006: Behind the Levee (EMI/Back Porch)2007: Street Symphony (EMI/Back Porch)2008: Live at the Ram's Head (Biographica)2009: Flower Petals (429 Records)2016: 4 on the Floor (I.
